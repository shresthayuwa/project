			<h1 class="np">Bus Fare Hike Announced by the Bus Union – What You Need to Know</h1>

			<p><b>Bus Fare Hike Across Nepal: A Closer Look at the Recent Announcement</b><br>In a move that has garnered widespread attention, the Bus Union of Nepal has officially announced a hike in bus fares, effective November 1, 2024. The decision, driven by increasing fuel prices and rising operational costs, is expected to affect public transport users across the country. This fare increase will apply to both short-distance and long-distance routes, and many daily commuters are already preparing for its impact.</p>

			<p><b>Why the Fare Increase?</b><br>According to the Bus Union, the fare hike comes after a thorough analysis of the growing financial strain on public transport operators. Rising diesel prices, coupled with increased maintenance costs, have left many bus operators struggling to maintain services at the current fare rates. A spokesperson from the Bus Union remarked:<br><i>"Our decision to raise fares is not taken lightly. We understand the challenges this may pose for commuters, but with the rising costs of fuel and vehicle maintenance, we were left with no choice if we are to continue providing reliable services."</i><br>The union has also mentioned that they have been in negotiations with the government to explore possible subsidies or fuel price controls, but no immediate relief was provided.</p>

			<p><b>New Fare Structure</b><br>Here’s a breakdown of the new fare structure across major routes:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Local City Buses:<br>
					<ul>
						<li>The minimum fare for short-distance city rides will increase by 20%.</li>
						<li>For instance, the previous fare of NPR 20 will now rise to NPR 24.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Intercity and Long-Distance Buses:
					<ul>
						<li>Long-distance bus fares will increase by 15-25%, depending on the route.</li>
						<li>Popular routes such as Kathmandu to Pokhara will see a fare increase from NPR 700 to NPR 850.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Student and Senior Citizen Discounts:
					<ul>
						<li>Discounts for students and senior citizens will still be applicable, though the percentage of the discount will be based on the new fares.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ol>

			<p>As the fare hike goes into effect, public transport users are encouraged to stay informed, explore their options, and adjust their daily budgets accordingly.</p>
